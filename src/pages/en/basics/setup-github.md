When people write code, they usually want a system to manage their code. Since code is basically text that is interpreted as actions, it's important to keep track of who created what change.

## What is Git?

Git (different from Github) is a system that helps software developers keep track of changes. We call this a **version control system** (VCS).

Code is stored in a central repository, which is usually somewhere other than your local computer. A repository is basically a folder that contains your code. 

When you want to edit it, you can download the code from the repository and edit it locally.

### Committing
    
When you make a change, you need to commit it. This is done by running the command `git commit` in your terminal. You can make multiple commits in a row.

### Pushing

Pushing updates the repository on the internet (the remote repository). This is done by running the command `git push`.

## What is [Github](https://github.com)?

Github is a website that helps you manage your code. It implements the version control system Git.

Projects are stored in your user or organization accounts, in a repository.

## Steps to get started

1. Create a Github account. You can do this for free at [Github](https://github.com/signup).

    - Name it whatever you'd like.
