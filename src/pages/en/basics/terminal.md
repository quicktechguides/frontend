The terminal, or command prompt is a program that lets you run commands in your computer. You can use it to run programs, open files, and even edit them. It is operated via text.

It is important to become familiar with the terminal since many programming tools do not have a non-terminal interface. This means that you will have to learn how to use the terminal to run programs.

## How to open the terminal

### On MacOS
The terminal on MacOS is called **Terminal.app**. To open the terminal, you can use Spotlight. Press `âŒ˜ + Space` to open Spotlight. Then, type `terminal` and then press `enter`.

## Common commands
There are a few commands that you will use most often.

For MacOS and Linux, some common commands are listed in [this article](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet). For Windows, an equivalent article is [here](https://serverspace.io/support/help/windows-cmd-commands-cheat-sheet/).

## Trying new things

The terminal is important for computer science and software development, but it is easy to do actions that you might not have intended. For example, you might delete files or corrupt some important information.

For this reason, we advise running commands in a separate computer to your local one. Luckily, there are many services available online for this purpose.
