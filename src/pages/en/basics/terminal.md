The terminal, or command prompt is a program that lets you run commands in your computer. You can use it to run programs, open files, and even edit them. It is operated via text.

It is important to become familiar with the terminal since many programming tools do not have a non-terminal interface. This means that you will have to learn how to use the terminal to run programs.

## How to open the terminal

### On MacOS
The terminal on MacOS is called **Terminal.app**. To open the terminal, you can use Spotlight. Press `âŒ˜ + Space` to open Spotlight. Then, type `terminal` and then press `enter`.
