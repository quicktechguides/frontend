Welcome to Quick Tech Guides.

This site is a collection of guides focussed around programming and technology that help you do common things **without prior programming knowledge**.

This site is suitable for beginners and people who are new to programming. Instead of following basic tutorials that teach you to add two numbers, you can get hands-on experience and build tools that you'll actually use.

All of our guides are listed on the left. You might want to get started with the 'Basics' section.

## Philosophy/Guiding Principles

### External resources

This website is intended as a collection of education resources over a source of centralized documentation. What this means is that we will regularly link to high-quality resources that are already available on the internet over writing our own guides.

This is intended for the benefit of the readers. There is no use reiterating what is already out there in a higher quality.

### Platform agnostic

These guides are meant to be *platform-agnostic*, meaning that they should be written so that people with any commmon computer can use them. Examples are usually provided for MacOS and Windows.

Note: if you have an iPad or a tablet, these guides may not be suitable for you. Check out our advanced guide on iPad development.

## Open source

This website is open source. What this means is that you can edit it and improve it, as well as add your own content if you believe that it will help. At the right of every page, you can find a link to the source code.

## Frontend development

The frontend is basically an edited version of the 'Documentation' example for the `astro` build tool. The original source code is [here](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/docs).
